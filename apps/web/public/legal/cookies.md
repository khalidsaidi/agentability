# Agentability Cookie Policy

Last updated: 2026-02-11

## Why we use cookies
Agentability uses a small set of cookies/storage values to keep the site functional and, with permission, to understand aggregate usage.

## Categories

### Essential storage (always active)
- Consent preference storage so we remember your accept/reject choice.
- Product UX state (for example, onboarding/tour state).

### Analytics cookies (optional)
- Google Analytics cookies are used only when you explicitly accept optional cookies.
- Analytics is disabled by default until consent is granted.

## Your choices
- You can **Accept all cookies** or **Reject optional cookies** from the consent popup.
- You can change your decision later from **Cookie settings** in the site footer.
- If you reject optional cookies, analytics cookies are disabled and existing GA cookies are cleared on this site where possible.
- If this policy changes materially, we may ask you to confirm your choice again.
